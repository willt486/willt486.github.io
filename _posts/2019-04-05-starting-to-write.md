In [this post](https://willt486.github.io/research/productivity/writing/2019/02/22/productive-reading/) I talked about how I'd used a new method to successfully increase the speed at which I was able to cover literature for a new project that I'm working on. In this post, I wanted to outline how I've used [WorkFlowy](http://workflowy.com/) to start the process of 'putting pen to paper'.

### WorkFlowy
WorkFlowy is a really useful outlining tool. Whilst it can be used to manage multiple to-do lists and for other functions, it's primary value to me is in helping to outline a piece of writing. I'm a big believer in the importance of structure and in making sure that the argument being presented flows smoothly from one thought to the next - this sort of planning is absolutely critical (for me at least) in producing something that is legible. I can create top-level headings and then keep breaking down sections until I am at the level of small sub-sections or even paragraphs. I can focus in on a particular section to try and avoid getting distracted (which is a **big** concern) and I can expand and collapse sections (or the whole document) to get an overview should I need it.

Also useful is the ability to create 'notes' for each of the headings. Whilst this is pretty useful, I found that I could start to create some of the text within WorkFlowy itself, before I moved to a word-processor. Of course, the features are rather limited, but in many ways, only being able to type, and not being able to distract myself with fonts, headings and styles is actually a bonus. 

Once you're 'done' then the resulting document can be 'exported' (actually just cut and paste) into the word-processor of your choice. It does, it's fair to say, require some formatting and some judicious use of headings to get the text under control, but that is relatively easily done.

I know that you **can** outline using a word-processor, but I found the experience of using WorkFlowy to be much more user friendly. The ability to focus in and then to draw back out is really helpful, being able to drag and drop headings is great for playing around with structure, and the use of notes to start to get some more detailed thoughts down is also great.

Why not give it a go?
