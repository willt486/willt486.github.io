I spend some time (ok, much more than I should) thinking about how to work more productively - primarily, with research and writing because I feel like I don't get as much time to do these as I really want. As a consequence, I'm a fan of colleagues such as [Raul Pacheco-Vega](http://www.raulpacheco.org/), [Mark S. Reed](https://www.profmarkreed.com/) and [Pat Thomson](https://patthomson.net/) who publish very sound and helpful advice on their websites, social media and in their publications.

Encouraged by my recent reading of [*The Productive Researcher* by Mark S. Reed](https://www.fasttrackimpact.com/the-productive-researcher) and, in particular, his 'How to write a literature review in one week' I set about trying to be much more productive in my reading today.

I'm not, incidentally, trying to write a literature review in one week.

Today, I managed to take notes on 18 articles relating to a conference paper that I am due to give at the end of June. Whether you think that number is impressive or not, it is more than I would usually manage, particularly when I also had to search various databases as well! I took a few lessons from Prof. Reed's book:

1. I concentrated on being focused on this *one* task - and not trying to do several things during the day
1. I was as discerning as possible about what I read - only spending time on articles I was fairly confident would say something that I would then use in the final work.
1. I did *not* try to read the whole article - despite knowing that many colleagues already do this, it is my usual practice to spend time on each article, reading it all, highlighting and making notes.
1. I also did not create 'rhetorical precis' for each article as I would usually (previously?) do. (This is a technique, learnt from Raul Pacheco-Vega, that I find useful as a way to really think about the value and purpose of an article, but the process is *slooooow*).
1. I captured notes using the system that Prof. Reed suggests - a simple spreadsheet with three columns:
   1. Quotations from the article (I preceeded them with the page number)
   1. A column for notes or comments from me, which is blank in most cases
   1. The reference for the article - just the author's name because I stored the citations in [RefWorks](https://www.refworks.com)

The result of this is a file with notes from a pleasing range of articles, most of which is useful for the writing that I will be doing.

I may not have worked an 8 hour day today, but I've achieved considerably more than I expected to...
