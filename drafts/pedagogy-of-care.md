This post is inspired by an article by [Catherine Denial](http://catherinedenial.org) about the [Pedagogy of Kindness](https://hybridpedagogy.org/pedagogy-of-kindness/). It is certainly *not* a 'response' to this post - not least because I agree with almost all that Prof Denial says in her piece. Nevertheless, I started to think about whether and how a Pedagogy of *Care* might differ from a Pedagogy of *Kindness*. I have worked with the Ethics of Care quite a bit - mostly in relation to the management of Health and Social Care - and have recently had cause to revist an article of Nel Noddings' entitled ['The Caring Relation in Teaching'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.745047). Reading the work of Noddings and Denial has prompted me to rethink my attitude to teaching (just in time for the start of a new academic year).

Denial's piece starts with a powerful paragraph in which she describes the way in which she used to approach teaching. It resonated with me because I shared much of the same thought patterns. Indeed, some of these ideas are embodied in the structures and processes that my (and many other institutions) have laid down. Take this sentence in particular:

> I was urged to be on the lookout for plagiarism, to be vigilent for cheaters, to assume that the students wouldn't do the reading, and to expect to be treated as a cogo in a consumerist machine by students who would challenge their grades on a whim.

Denial's reflection on this approach, and her solution - fostered on the idea of building trust - describes an approach to education that strikes a chord with me and which I believe will better support students. Whilst she touches briefly on the importance of building relationships with students, it is this element which I think is worth exploring a little further, drawing on three core elements of the ethic of care.

The first element is the idea of a **relational ontology** - that is, humans are fundamentally relational beings where the proper (or at least a significant) object of our attention. Often, those working within the framework of the ethics of care will focus on 'caring relationships' characterised by a person that provides care and one who receives care; although frequently our relationships are more complex than this, particularly in informal, family settings. Within an educational setting, the implication is that our attention should be on the nature and the quality of the relationship between the student and the tutor (although the idea of a provider of education and a receiver of education does not translate to this context). Proper questions therefore might be: 'what type of relationship is most appropriate?' and 'how is this relationship best fostered and maintained?'
