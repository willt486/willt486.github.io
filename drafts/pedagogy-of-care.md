This post is inspired by a post by [Catherine Denial](http://catherinedenial.org) about the [Pedagogy of Kindness](https://hybridpedagogy.org/pedagogy-of-kindness/). It is certainly *not* a 'response' to this post - not least because I agree with almost all that Prof Denial says in her piece. Nevertheless, I started to think about whether and how a Pedagogy of *Care* might differ from a Pedagogy of *Kindness*. I have worked with the Ethics of Care quite a bit - mostly in relation to the management of Health and Social Care - and have recently had cause to revist an article of Nel Noddings' entitled ['The Caring Relation in Teaching'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.745047). Reading the work of Noddings and Denial has prompted me to rethink my attitude to teaching (just in time for the start of a new academic year).
