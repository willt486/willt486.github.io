On this page is some information about current projects that I have underway (in various stages of progress). This is the location for some descriptions of the projects; updates will follow as posts at the front of the site. You will also, over time, find links to resources that I have produced on these pages and on the 'Resources' tab at the top of the site.

### The Ethics of Care

Much of my most recent work has applied ideas from the 'Ethics of Care' to challenges within the Health and Social Care sector. In doing so, my ambition is to bring together applied moral theory with analysis of 'wicked' problems of management. Examples of this work can be found in *The Management of Wicked Problems in Health and Social Care* which was recently published by Routledge. In addition to editing this volume, I wrote chapters on the *The Politics of Care* (with Dr Sue Hollinrake) that discusses the impact of recent reforms in the English social care system and on *Unpicking Dependency; Managing Becoming* in which I look at the idea of dependency within the management of chronic disease.

Broadly speaking, much of my work is on developing these ideas and looking for ways in which the principles of the 'Ethics of Care' can be useful in domains other than those most closely related to the act (physical or otherwise) of caring. This includes, for example, some work in which these ideas are applied to issues of migration and the impact of Brexit.
