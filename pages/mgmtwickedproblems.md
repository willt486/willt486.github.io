title: The Management of Wicked Problems in Health and Social Care
subtitle: Routledge Studies in Health Management
---

This book is the result of work that I shared with colleagues from the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/etusivu) and the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). It contains contributions from academics across a range of disciplines, from different countries and based in different types of health or social care setting. As a result, it is a rich collection of studies and insights into the nature of wicked problems, their manifestation in practice and ways in which we might look to tackle some of their effects.

"At a time of growing pressure of health and social care services, this book draws together contributions which highlight contemporary challenges for their management. Providing a range of contributions that draw on  a Critical Management Studies perspective, the book raises macro-level concerns with theory, demographics and economics on the one hand, as well as micro-level challenges of leadership, voice and engagement on the other. Rather than being an attempt to define the 'wickedness' of problems in this field, this book provides new insights designed to be of interest and value to researchers, students and managers."
