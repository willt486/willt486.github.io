title: Writing
subtitle: Some Ideas and Techniques
---

I will use this page to gather some of the posts (forthcoming) on approaches I use for steps in planning and writing. The idea is that this should form a useful repository for students and colleagues to refer to for ideas. I make no claim to have created these techniques (other than in adapting to my way of working) nor do I claim that these are the 'best' way or some sort of 'gold standard'. They are just ideas and things that I find useful.

Over time, I plan to create pages that look at:

### Gathering and organising materials, reading and references
[Productive Reading](https://willt486.github.io/research/productivity/writing/2019/02/22/productive-reading/)

### Outlining and planning work
[Outlining: Getting the Structure Right](https://willt486.github.io/research/productivity/writing/2019/04/05/starting-to-write/)

### The process of writing and editing
