title: Writing
subtitle: Some Ideas and Techniques
---

I will use this page to gather some of the posts (forthcoming) on approaches I use for steps in planning and writing. The idea is that this should form a useful repository for students and colleagues to refer to for ideas. I make no claim to have created these techniques (other than in adapting to my way of working) nor do I claim that these are the 'best' way or some sort of 'gold standard'. They are just ideas and things that I find useful.

Over time, I plan to create pages that look at:

### Gathering and organising materials, reading and references

### Outlining and planning work

### The process of writing and editing
