The story of George Caroll's first mission for the Agency. (9 segment rope - segment 1)

On his first day at the Agency, Carroll is called into Telsa Beck's office..."I hear great things about you George. I can only hope they're true." She turns to face him a grim look on her face..."I wouldn't normally send a new agent out on their first day...but today I have no choice. Be very careful, stay in touch". Beck hands over a manilla file with the words 'Top Secret' stamped on it. She looks up and smiles briefly..."I know, it's a cliche - but we have keep up appearences."

*Q - Why does Beck have so much trust in Carroll?*

> Set-up rolls: 8 - The mission; 6 - Gain the Trust of Someone; Setting - London, 1958 (fiat); Antagonist (initial) 6 - Someone you Know; Antagonist (detail) 1 - Former Lover

Opening the folder Carroll did not expect to recognise the target of his first mission. The photograph, clearly taken through a long lens, shows Eleanor Weber, kissing the cheek of a large man in a badly-tailored grey suit. During their second year at Faulkner College they had dated for 5 months. a steamy romance that ended when Carroll found Eleanor in bed with another man. He broke off their relationship immediately, and showed little concern when, 3 days later, he learnt that the other man had been found unconscious in an alleyway with 3 broken ribs. They hadn't talked since.

He takes a sip of water and reads..."The man in the picture is Zakariya Luna, also known as 'The Prophet', here under the pretence of promoting next month's tour of the Bolshoi Ballet. We know he has connections with Soviet intelligence agencies and with organised crime across Europe. Your job is to get close to Weber, find out what she knows, and work out why The Prophet is really in London...Be careful, he is known to be violent."

Carroll leans back in his chair...where to start? How might he even go about finding Weber now anyway? Picking up his coat and hat he heads out.

Arriving at the offices of 'The Banner', a small newspaper of dubious quality, he heads straight to the reception desk..."I'm looking for Barney. Is he in?"

> Does the receptionist know? Oracle - 3 - No, but

"No, you've just missed him actually. He's gone to lunch at The Tailor."

Thanking the girl for her time, Carroll heads out of the door and towards The Tailor, a nondescript pub on the edge of London's fashion district.

> Is Barney there? Oracle - 6 - Yes, and

Entering the pub, Carroll immediately spots Barney Bate at the bar talking with a familiar-looking large man. Why is his friend sat with Luna? He approaches the two men.

> How does Barney react? Charisma risk - 3 dice - 13 (pass)

"Hello, George, great to see you! How the devil are you?" Barney warmly greets Carroll as he approaches, shaking his hand as he does so..."Let me get you a drink...this is Mr Zakariya Luna from the Soviet Ministry of Culture...I'm doing a piece on next month's tour of the Bolshoi."

"Pleased to meet you." Carroll shakes the Russian's hand. The three men make smalltalk before the Russian looks at his watch, stands, and leaves having promised to call Barney to arrange dinner.

"So, what brings you to The Tailor? Not just the great beer?"..."No, as it happens, I need your help Barney. I need to find Eleanor."..."You are kidding, right? I'm pretty sure she's still pissed off with you after what happened to Rex"

> Can Carroll convince Barney to help? Charisma risk + Lie - 6 dice (Challenging, Barney is perceptive, wager 2) - 13 (pass)

"Yeah, I know, she won't want to speak with me. The thing is, I found something of hers when I unpacked my stuff last week and I want to return it. I think it's important to her, it's a locket she always said belonged to her Grandmother."

> Does Barney know where Eleanor is? Oracle (+2 from Role benefit) - 2+2 - Yes, but

"I think I can help. I haven't heard from her in a while, but I know she was working at one of the Theatres...something to do with costumes and props I think...The Alhambra" Carroll gets up, thanks Barney and heads to the West End, feeling slightly nervous about encountering Eleanor again. Things had not exactly gone well last them they spoke.
