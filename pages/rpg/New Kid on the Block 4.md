(segment 4)

Carroll finds himself walking along Orange Street, heading towards Charing Cross Road. He has a name, and a lead, but how could he find this ticket tout?

> Can Carroll spot Ida Hood? Perception risk + Ability - 7 dice (DIsastrous threat, only lead at the moment, wager 4 inc free 1) - 10 (pass)

Turning the corner into Charing Cross Road, Carroll spots a women standing outside the Garrick Theatre approaching passers by, most of whom seem to ignore her.

> Encounter roll, BFJB - 4, 63 - malicious person (possibility of ill-disposition towards Carroll)

> Is Ida feeling malicious towards Carroll? 50/50 (high yes, low no) - 1 (no)

Carroll explains that he needs information about the Ballet, and about why Eleanor might have received a call from a Russian that left her in tears.

> Can Ida help? Oracle (+2 from Role benefit) - 1+2 - No, but

"I don't know who's calling your girlfriend, but I've heard this Ballet trip is cover for some other activity. I heard something about a shipment coming in."...Carroll doesn't react, but this news fits with the glimpse of information he got from the note in Eleanor's office.

> Does Ida know anything about The Prophet? 50/50 (high yes, low no) - 4 (yes)

"What do you know about a man called The Prophet?"

> GMA - Remember, Diabolical, Purity

"I know he's got quite the reputation...not a nice guy, holds grudge and is properly vicious. Stay well clear." 

> Does Ida know more than she's letting on? Oracle - 5 - Yes, but

"Look, I don't know if it's connected, but I heard a rumour that he was looking for someone...a woman. The guy I spoke to didn't know her name, just called her Pomes...that's it...I have to get back to work."

Carroll thanked Ida. Walking back towards the Agency he thought...Pomes...Mongrel...it didn't seem to make much sense. It's clear that something is going to be delivered and Eleanor wasn't being given any choice but to help. Perhaps if he could find this mongrel they would know something. It seems the only way forward is to go back to try and talk to Eleanor.

*Q - Who is Pomes? What is the Shipment?*
