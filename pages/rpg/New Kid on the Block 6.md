(segment 6)

As Carroll walked slowly back towards the Agency he thought about what he'd found out. The Prophet, supposedly in London to arrange the visit of the Bolshoi Ballet next month, was threatening Eleanor. She, it turns out, is estranged from her birth-father, a man who is connected to The Prophet and has now been kidnapped. Unless Eleanor helps The Prophet steal paintings when the Ballet visits her theatre he will hurt her father and her mother.

Carroll swore gently under his breath. Was that really it? Was it really all about art theft?

> Is it all about art theft? Oracle - 2 - No, but

It couldn't be - there had to be something else to it. Carroll decided to visit Cally Stone, the Con Ops analyst who seemed to always know what to do.

"Hey Cally, I need some help...it seems that The Prophet is planning to steal paintings loaned to the Bolshoi Ballet when they visit next month. Have you heard anything about something like that?"

> Oracle - 5 - Yes, but

"Actually, I have heard something about that, but we weren't convinced it was really about art works. It would really help if we knew which paintings he was after. I suggest you get to the National Gallery and speak with Isaiah Lancaster - Head of Collections. He'll know which paintings are being loaned out."

Carroll arrived at the National Gallery and smiled at the woman on the information desk..."Is Mr Lancaster available please?"

> What's Lancaster like? BFJB - 2, 16 - decent person

A tall, well-dressed man approaches and shakes Carroll's hand, gently leading him towards a nearby office. "I  understand you need some information?" Carroll explains what he needs, claiming he represents the Gallery's insurance company.

> Can he convince Lancaster to help him? Charisma risk + Lie - 6 dice (Challenging risk, Lancaster is skeptical, wager 2) - 12 (pass)

Lancaster, clearly not convinced, agrees to help and sits down behind a desk, pulling out a sheet of papers..."The ballet is coming to perform Don Quixote...we've agreed to lend them three pieces, works that are not part of our normal display. Fine works, very fine indeed."

Lancaster hands Carroll a sheet of paper with the names of three works of art written on it..."Are they valuable?"..."Surely you know the value Mr Carroll...it is listed on our insurance schedule"...."Mmmm, yes...I can look it up I suppose..."They are valuable works, about Â£200,000 each...not an enormous sum...and clearly we have much more valuable works."..Carroll thanks Lancaster, folds the sheet of paper and leaves.

Returning to the Agency, Carroll takes the paper to Cally..."You know...this on is strange. It doesn't seem to fit the ballet at all. It's too modern and the subject doesn't fit."

> What's the painting like? GMA - being pulled in different directions, temperence, envy

"It's a painting with a moral message, a scene from a Greek play, but its really about a man torn apart by his wild and self-indulgent nature."

"Seriously? And you think this is what The Prophet wants?"..."Well, it stands out, the others are fairly typical scenes by Spanish painters - they fit in terms of time and theme."

> Does Cally know why The Prophet might want this painting? Oracle - 6 - Yes, and

> GMA - harnessed power, world-changing ability

"I don't think it's really about the painting...it's a test"..."Of who?"..."Eleanor. He's testing her, seeing how far she will go to protect her family. I think once she does this he will ask more of her...I mean, once she's helped him steal a painting..."

"You think he's recruiting her?"..."I think that's the most likely explanation."

Carroll leaves, without bothering to pick up his coat and hat.
