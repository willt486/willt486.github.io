(segment 3)

Carroll left the theatre building using the side door. On the street outside, he paused to think...why was the Alhambra expecting boxes with dangerous contents? Does Eleanor know? Why was she crying when he arrived?

"Did you find her ok?" Carroll spun around to see the young man who had helped him earlier...."Uh, yeah...thanks" Carroll sense an opportunity..."You know...you really shouldn't have just let me in like that...I could have been anyone."

> How does the man react? Charisma risk + Ruthless - 6 dice (Challenging, out on a limb, wager 2) - 14 (pass)

"Fuck man, I'm sorry...don't tell anyone, I can't afford to lose my job."..."Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. In fact, perhaps we could help each other out?"..."Like how?"..."Ms Weber was rather upset when I got ther...maybe you know why?"

> Can the man help? Charisma risk + Secret - 6 dice (Typical, already friendly, wager 1) - 21 (pass)

"I don't know much...she seemed ok this morning...she had a phone call just before you got there. That must have been what upset her."..."I guess so. Do you know who called her?"

> Does the man know anything about the call? Oracle - 5 - Yes, but

"I put the call through to her. I don't know who it was, but he sounded foreign...Russian maybe."..."Hmmm...thanks...listen, if she's in trouble I want to help. Do you think you could call me if she gets another call like that?"..."Yeah, I guess so..."..."Thank you...say, what's your name?" Carroll hands him a card with his name and number on it..."I'm Ned...Ned Whitfield."

Turning, Carroll thanks Whitfield and turns to head back to Agency HQ.

> Does Carroll go directly back to HQ? Oracle -  2 - No, but
> Tarot - resolve, overcoming adversity, finding solutions

Carroll stops in the middle of the street, turns on his heel and heads back towards Saville Row. Pushing on the door of a small, but expensive-looking, shop he enters.

"Mr Carroll, how nice to see you"...Carroll shakes the hand of the elderly man standing with a tape measure around his neck. "How can Foster and Hungerford be of service to you today, sir?"..."Fenton, today I need some rather special help"..."Sir?"..."I'm not here to buy a suit"..."Sir?"..."I think you might be able to help me find someone..."

> Can Fenton help?  Perceptiveness risk + Ability + Codename - 8 dice (Dangerous risk, Fenton doesn't give information out easily, even to friends, wager 3 inc free wager) -  17 (pass)

"That is certainly a possiblility...who do you need to find?"..."That's the other problem...I don't know"..."Well, that will make it a little more difficult"..."I need to know more about the Bolshoi's visit to London next month."..."Maybe...I think I know someone who might help you"

Things are looking up..."Ida Hood. She buys and sells tickets...always knows whats going on. She's pretty well connected too. Normally found not far from the Garrick"..."Thanks Fenton."

Carroll leaves in a hurry and heads back towards the Theatre district.
