(segment 7)

> Segment Suggestion Roll - 3 - A betrayal

Carroll stood in front of the Alhambra Theatre wondering how he should play the next few minutes. He instinct was to protect Eleanor, but maybe he could do better...

> Might Eleanor be recruited as a double-agent? Oracle - 3 - No, but

On secondthoughts, he had to keep her safe; but he still had to stop The Prophet...Making his way to Eleanor's office he started to devise a plan.

"You need to call him, get him to come here"..."Then what? What's the plan George? He's dangerous...you do know that right?"

Carroll looked at Eleanor, barely keeping his frustration under control. "Yes, I do understand that."

> Is Eleanor able to get The Prophet to the Theatre? Oracle - 6 - Yes, and

> How did The Prophet react? BFJB - 6, 56 - one whose fates are troublesome

"He's on his way over, and he sounded worried. I've never heard him like that before."

15 minutes later, the large frame of Zakariya Luna stood in the doorway. "You said there was a problem" Luna ignored Carroll, "I really hope that isn't the case. I would hate for anything to happen to your dear father Yelena" Luna pronounced her name in the Russian style.

Carroll stood. "I'm afraid there is a problem - we know all about your plan. Ordinarily of course we would have waited and caught you red-handed, but in this case perhaps we can come to a more...amicable...arrangement?"

> Is Carroll able to persuade The Prophet? Charisma risk + Revenge - 6 dice (Dangerous risk, The Prophet remains a threat but is cornered - wager 3) - 5 (fail)

"I don't think so actually George..." Eleanor took a step towards The Prophet..."You were right dorogoi...he never saw it coming. There never was a plan to steal artwork, and my father has been dead for years. This is far bigger than some petty theft."

* Q - So what is it about then? *

For a moment, Carroll looked incredulous at Eleanor and The Prophet, his arm protectively around her shoulder. He thought, took one step towards the large man and, pulling his flick knife out of his pocket thurst it towards the large Russian's stomach.

> STRIKE! Violence + Strike + Fine weapon - 6 dice (wager 2); The Prophet is stronger, but surprised and unable to get to his weapon (3 dice) - Carroll 17; The Prophet 6

Carroll buries his knife into The Prophet's stomach, twisting it as he does so. The man falls to the floor, his shirt already starting to turn red. Carroll stumbles as he moves to the door, running out.

Back at the Agency, Carroll stood in front of Telsa Beck's desk, his hand still covered in The Prophet's blood.

"You did well George" Beck almost smiled, "we know The Prophet is up to something, and we know who to watch. The management at the Alhambra have cancelled the Ballet and the National Gallery won't be lending out any paintings. I want you to keep a watch for The Prophet, work with Cally, make sure you track him - and Eleanor."
