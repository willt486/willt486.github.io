(segment 5)

Carroll walked back towards the Alhambra Theatre and spots Ned outside smoking. He asks whether Eleanor has received any more phones calls...

> Has she? Oracle - 5 - Yes, but

"Yes, several - but none from any foreign bloke...one came looking for her mind"..."Did you get his name?"

> Did Ned get his name? Oracle - 4 - Yes, but

"I did...or at least he gave me a name...called himself Zack"...Carroll felt a sense of nausea...Pushing Ned aside he went down to Eleanor's office. Standing at the door, there were papers everywhere. Eleanor was on her knees next to her desk, gathering together some of the strewn documents.

> How does Eleanor react to seeing Carroll? GMA - Reveal an unexpected truth

She looks up, "Blyad, fuck, George what do you want?"..."That's not very nice Eleanor...and since when did you speak Russain?"

> Can Carroll find out why Eleanor swore in Russain? Perception risk + Secret + Education - 9 dice (Disastrous threat, Eleanor's big secret, wager 4 inc free 1) - 30 (pass)

"My birth father was Russian...I spent all my summers in Russia until I was 16 and old enough to decide I didn't want to see him any more"..."How come?"

> GMA - Conceited, Armed, Oblivious to the feelings of others

"He wasn't a very nice guy...had some pretty nasty friends and I had a feeling it was getting out of hand...I didn't want to have any part of that."

> Is Eleanor's father The Prophet? - Oracle - 3 - No, but

"So how do you know this Zack guy?"..."He's a friend of my father...or rather, my father worked for him"

"You're Pomes?"..."Where did you hear that word?"..."It's hardly a secret Eleanor, some woman on the street told me"

> Is Eleanor being blackmailed by The Prophet? Oracle -  6 - Yes, and

"He told me that if I didn't help him he would hurt my father...and it wouldn't stop there...he'd come after my mother"..."So what's in the shipment?"

> Does Eleanor know what's in the shipment? Orcale - 4 - Yes, but

> GMA (Treasure) Old masterpiece painting; (Quest, Complication) Something goes missing

"I don't know the exact plan, but I think they're planning to steal some paintings. We often borrow art works to dress the set - it's a good way for the galleries to earn some money with paintings that aren't on show - I think they plan to swap out the real ones for fakes"..."Are these paintings valuable?"..."Some, yes, but I don't know which ones they'll be"..."Then clearly he knows someone who does...Look, I want to help"

> Will Eleanor let him? Oracle - 3 - No, but

"You can't, it's far too dangerous...but I do appreciate the offer"..."Then at least let me try and find out what The Prophet's up to."

> Charisma risk + Secret - 6 dice (Dangerous risk, The Prophet is a very dangerous guy, wager 3) - 10 (pass)

"OK, but be careful George" she reaches out to touch his arm, but before she can, Carroll has turned and left.
