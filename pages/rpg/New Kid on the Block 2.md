(segment 2)

Coming out of The Tailor, Carroll heads towards the Alhambra Theatre - the last known workplace of Eleanor Weber. As he walked briskly towards Leicester Square he had a sense someone was looking at him.

> Is Carroll being followed? Oracle - 2 - No, but

Carroll remembered his training, checking carefully for a tail. He assured himself that there was no-one there, but yet the unconfortable feeling remained - something was not quite right.

Carroll arrives at the Alhambra Theatre just after 1.30, the doors are shut and the lights are off. It seems shut. Carroll looks down the alley to the side of the building.

> Can he find a way in? Perception risk - 3 dice (free wager) - 11 (pass)

He's in luck, the side door to the theatre is wedged open with a box. Carroll glances behind to check no-one is looking and slips inside. He pauses for a moment, deciding how to find Eleanor.

> Is there anything nearby to help him? Oracle - 6 - Yes, and

Looking to his left, Carroll sees a large bunch of flowers with a note attached. As he hears someone coming he picks them up..."Can I help you? Who are those for?" Carroll looks up to see a young man wearing the Theatre uniform..."Good afternoon, I was rather hoping to give these to Ms Weber"...

> Does the young man believe Carroll? Charisma risk + Lie + Ability - 8 dice (Typical risk, wager 1) - 21 (pass)

"Yes, sir. I think she is in her office...end of the corridor, down stairs, second on your right."

Carroll follows the young man's instructions, squeezing past boxes, costumes and assorted props. He dumps the flowers in a dark spot behind some panels witih circus scenes painted on them. Coming to Eleanor's office he takes a deep breath before knocking.

> Is Eleanor there? Oracle - 6 - Yes, and

"Yes"...pushing open the door, Carroll sees Eleanor at her desk. She looks up, wiping away tears from her face..."George..." 

"Hello Eleanor" Carroll takes one step into the room..."What the fuck do you want?" she asks..."Nice to see you too" Carroll smiles..."Seriously George, what the fuck do you want...you're not here to catch up I take it?"..."Ah...no...you see, I actually need your help."

> How will Eleanor react? Charisma risk + Lie - 6 dice (Dangerous risk, Eleanor knows Carroll well, wager 3) - 7 (fail)

"I really don't think I need to help you...not after everything...not after what you did to Rex."..."I know, and I'm sorry...I really am..." As Eleanor holds her head in her hands, Carroll takes the chance to steal a look at the papers on her desk.

> Does Carroll notice anything of interest? Perception risk + Secrets - 6 dice (Challenging risk, he has little time, wager 2 inc free wager) - 14 (pass)

As he quickly scans the documents, Carroll notices one of interest. Although it's not in English, he recognises the writting as Cyrillic.

> Is Carroll able to read the contents of the document? Intellect test + Background (3d6) - 7 dice (Challenging risk, he has little time, wager 2) - 25 (pass)

Just before Eleanor looks up, Carroll is able to make out the contents of the top document. I appears to be some sort of shipping note detailing the contents of boxes due to arrive next week for the Bolshoi Ballet. He recognises one name, that of Zakariya Luna and one other word 'opasnost' or warning..."I think you should go George...I can't deal with this today."

*Q - Why had Eleanor been crying before George arrived?*
