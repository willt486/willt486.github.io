subtitle: Routledge Studies in Health Management
---

This book is the result of work that I shared with colleagues from the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/etusivu) and the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). It contains contributions from academics across a range of disciplines, from different countries and based in different types of health or social care setting. As a result, it is a rich collection of studies and insights into the nature of wicked problems, their manifestation in practice and ways in which we might look to tackle some of their effects.
